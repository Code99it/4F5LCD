# Installation

Follow these steps for vehicles based on the 4F (C6) platform of the VAG group:

1. **Remove front trim**  
   Release the clips holding the instrument cluster’s front trim and carefully pull the trim away.

2. **Remove main screws**  
   Unscrew the four large metal screws around the instrument cluster.

3. **Remove instrument cluster**  
   Carefully pull the instrument cluster out of its housing and disassemble it as needed.

4. **Remove original display**  
   Gently lift the stock display out of its enclosure.

5. **Install new display**  
   Insert the replacement display module. Mount the associated microcontroller board in a suitable, insulated location.

6. **Reinstall front trim and main screws**  
   Slide the instrument cluster back into place, tighten all main screws, and snap the decorative trim back on.

7. **Attach Y-splitters to relevant control units**  
   - **Steering column electronics (e.g., J527):**  
     Located in the steering column behind the steering wheel. Remove the lower cover of the steering column and insert the Y-splitter between the original connector and the control unit.  
     
   - **Gateway control unit (e.g., J533 / diagnostic interface):**  
     Typically located on a support beam above the brake pedal behind the lower dashboard on the driver’s side. Remove the lower dashboard panel, locate the gateway connector, and insert the Y-splitter in line.
