   Release the clips holding the instrument cluster’s front trim and carefully pull the trim away.

2. **Remove main screws**  
   Unscrew the four large metal screws around the instrument cluster.

3. **Remove instrument cluster**  
   Pull the instrument cluster out of its housing and disassemble as needed.

4. **Remove original display**  
   Gently lift the factory display out of its enclosure.

5. **Install new display**  
   Insert the replacement display. Mount the matching microcontroller board in a suitable location.

6. **Reinstall front trim and main screws**  
   Slide the instrument cluster back into place, tighten all main screws, and snap the decorative trim back on.

7. **Attach Y-splitters to control units J527 and J533**  
   - **J527 (steering column electronics):** Located in the steering column behind the wheel. Remove the lower steering column cover and insert your Y-splitter between the factory connector and the control unit.  
   - **J533 (gateway/diagnostic interface):** Found on the support strut above the brake pedal behind the lower dash on the driver’s side. Remove the lower dash panel, locate the gateway connector, and insert your Y-adapter in line.
